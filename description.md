# Application First Page: The Hub

The first page of the application is the **Hub**, which serves as the central navigation and interaction point for the user. It is a feature-rich interface with a three-column layout, designed to provide a comprehensive and engaging user experience.

## Layout

The Hub's layout is divided into three main sections:

1.  **Left Sidebar:** This sidebar is dedicated to displaying a list of available games.
2.  **Main Content:** The central area of the page is the primary content section, where users can browse, search, and filter games.
3.  **Right Sidebar:** This sidebar provides access to user-specific features like profile information and social interactions.

## Interactive Features

### Main Content

The main content area is where the majority of user interaction occurs. It includes the following interactive features:

*   **Search Bar:** A search bar at the top of the main content allows users to search for specific games by name.
*   **Genre Filters:** Below the search bar, a set of buttons allows users to filter the displayed games by genre.
*   **Sort Options:** To the right of the genre filters, there are options to sort the games based on different criteria.
*   **Game Grid:** The main area displays a grid of game cards. Each card represents a game and is clickable. When a user clicks on a game card, the view transitions to a detailed view of that game within the main content area.
*   **Game View:** When a game is selected, the game grid is replaced by a detailed game view, which provides more information about the selected game and options to interact with it. The user can close this view to return to the game grid.
*   **"Tha Battlefield" Pre-Match Lobby:** This is a special overlay that appears when a user decides to start a "Tha Battlefield" game. This lobby allows the user to configure the match settings before starting. The configuration options include:

    *   **Mode Selection:** Buttons to choose between a "1v1 Duel" or a "Team Battle".

    *   **Start Battle:** A button to start the game with the selected configuration.
    *   **Cancel:** A button to close the lobby and return to the hub.

### Left Sidebar

### Right Sidebar
